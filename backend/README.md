### Getting Started

-   Base URL: At present this app can only be run locally and is not hosted as a base URL. The backend app is hosted at the default, `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`, which is set as a proxy in the frontend configuration.
-   Authentication: This version of the application does not require authentication or API keys.

### Error Handling

Errors are returned as JSON objects in the following format:

```
{
    "success": False,
    "error": 400,
    "message": "bad request"
}
```

The API will return three error types when requests fail:

-   400: Bad Request
-   404: Resource Not Found
-   422: Not Processable
-   500: Internal Server Error
